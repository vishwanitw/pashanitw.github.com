<p>
    I am full time javascript developer and part time designer using sketch app.
    I have developed interactive rich modern web applications using javascript technologies like angular js ,react js and lodash etc.
    Now a days,I completely focused on Hybrid apps and Responsive mobile web development using Es6,Flow,webpack and react js.
    Though, I spent most of my professional career in front end development, I also love to develop native apps using swift and
    backend development using node js and python.

<p>
    Apart from the traditional web development, I am more interested in applying mathematics and computer science algorithms to solve problems.
    Recently, I have started game development using webgl,three js,phaser js and unity 3d. I am also beginner in creating 3d-art using Blender.

    When i'm not in online, I spend my time with my family,friends,travelling and watching movies.
